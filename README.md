# unlikely_conversation

 ml5.js + tensorflow

A [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) application (built on top of [tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)) that uses a pretrained model on the corpus of Darwin, Hemingway, Shakespeare and Donald Trump.

The application seeds a conversation between all 4 models each feeding the conversation to the next.
